Peter Paul
==========

This project will manage data that is core to Peter Paul Development Center.
Peter Paul also makes extensive use of third party data, such as RPS data and MAP data,
but this data will be managed in a separate project, as the ability to manage that data
may be useful to more parties than Peter Paul.
